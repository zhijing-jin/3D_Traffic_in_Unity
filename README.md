# 3D_Traffic_in_Unity
This is a 3D simulation of real-world traffic in the game engine, Unity. 

It uses Python to populate data on a local Flask server, updating real-time vehicle information like positions, directions, etc.

## Paper
Here is the white paper [3D Traffic Simulation for Autonomous Vehicles in Unity and Python](./Documentation/Paper_3D_Traffic_Simulation.pdf).

## File Structure
* Documentation

* Implementation
  * Python Folder: stores the [Python code](./Implementation/Python) to contruct roads, and to generate position updates for vehicles.
  * Unity Folder: stores the [Unity Project](./Implementation/Unity), incl. assets, scripts, etc.
